Part of [Rapids](https://rapids.ai) cuGraph, Property Graph allows all the great benefits of cuGraph to be applied to property-rich datasets stored in a graph structure.
Property Graph enables:

* Multiple edge and node types
* Subgraph extractions based on properties and/or edge and node types.
* Storage of properties either within the graph structure on gpu or using GNN-centric storage extensions on host storage.
* Adding additional properties, nodes and edges into the property graph.
* Client access to a property graph managed by a remote cuGraph server.
