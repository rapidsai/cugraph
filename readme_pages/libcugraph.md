[Libcugraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph/blob/branch-22.12/cpp/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) is the Rapids C/C++ library for graph processing. The library provides a C++ API for users wanting low-level access. Users familiar with C/C++/CUDA and graph structures can access libcugraph and libcugraph_c for integration outside of python.
