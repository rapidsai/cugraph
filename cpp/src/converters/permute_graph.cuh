 * This function takes a graph and a permutation vector and permutes the
 * graph according to the permutation vector. So each vertex id i becomes
 * vertex id permutation[i] in the permuted graph.
 *
 * @param graph The graph to permute.
 * @param permutation The permutation vector to use, must be a valid permutation
 * i.e. contains all values 0-n exactly once.
 * @param result View of the resulting graph... note this should be pre allocated
 *               and number_of_vertices and number_of_edges should be set
 * @return The permuted graph.
