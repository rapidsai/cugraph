 * Method to find matches to a pattern against an indexed table.
 * @param pattern The pattern to match against. It is assumed that the order of the entries
 *  matches the order of the columns in the table being searched.
 * @param table The table to find matching entries within.
 * @param frontier The frontier of already bound values. The search is restricted to entries in the
 * table which match at least the frontier entry. If the frontier is null, then the entire table
 * will be scanned.
 * @param indexColumn The name of the variable in the pattern which is bound to the frontier
 *  and which indicates which index should be used on the table.
 * @return A result table with columns for each variable in the given pattern containing the bound
 *  values to those variables.
