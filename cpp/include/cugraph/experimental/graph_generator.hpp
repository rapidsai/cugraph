/**
 * @brief generate an edge list for an R-mat graph.
 *
 * This function allows multi-edges and self-loops similar to the Graph 500 reference
 * implementation.
 *
 * @p scramble_vertex_ids needs to be set to `true` to generate a graph conforming to the Graph 500
 * specification (note that scrambling does not affect cuGraph's graph construction performance, so
 * this is generally unnecessary). If `edge_factor` is given (e.g. Graph 500), set @p num_edges to
 * (size_t{1} << @p scale) * `edge_factor`. To generate an undirected graph, set @p b == @p c and @p
 * clip_and_flip = true. All the resulting edges will be placed in the lower triangular part
 * (inculding the diagonal) of the graph adjacency matrix.
 *
 * For multi-GPU generation with `P` GPUs, @p seed should be set to different values in different
 * GPUs to avoid every GPU generating the same set of edges. @p num_edges should be adjusted as
 * well; e.g. assuming `edge_factor` is given, set @p num_edges = (size_t{1} << @p scale) *
 * `edge_factor` / `P` + (rank < (((size_t{1} << @p scale) * `edge_factor`) % P) ? 1 : 0).
 *
 * @tparam vertex_t Type of vertex identifiers. Needs to be an integral type.
 * @param handle RAFT handle object to encapsulate resources (e.g. CUDA stream, communicator, and
 * handles to various CUDA libraries) to run graph algorithms.
 * @param scale Scale factor to set the number of verties in the graph. Vertex IDs have values in
 * [0, V), where V = 1 << @p scale.
 * @param num_edges Number of edges to generate.
 * @param a a, b, c, d (= 1.0 - (a + b + c)) in the R-mat graph generator (vist https://graph500.org
 * for additional details). a, b, c, d should be non-negative and a + b + c should be no larger
 * than 1.0.
 * @param b a, b, c, d (= 1.0 - (a + b + c)) in the R-mat graph generator (vist https://graph500.org
 * for additional details). a, b, c, d should be non-negative and a + b + c should be no larger
 * than 1.0.
 * @param c a, b, c, d (= 1.0 - (a + b + c)) in the R-mat graph generator (vist https://graph500.org
 * for additional details). a, b, c, d should be non-negative and a + b + c should be no larger
 * than 1.0.
 * @param seed Seed value for the random number generator.
 * @param clip_and_flip Flag controlling whether to generate edges only in the lower triangular part
 * (including the diagonal) of the graph adjacency matrix (if set to `true`) or not (if set to
 * `false`).
 * @param scramble_vertex_ids Flag controlling whether to scramble vertex ID bits (if set to `true`)
 * or not (if set to `false`); scrambling vertx ID bits breaks correlation between vertex ID values
 * and vertex degrees. The scramble code here follows the algorithm in the Graph 500 reference
 * implementation version 3.0.0.
 * @return std::tuple<rmm::device_uvector<vertex_t>, rmm::device_uvector<vertex_t>> A tuple of
 * rmm::device_uvector objects for edge source vertex IDs and edge destination vertex IDs.
