 * Centrality score in every iteration or `nullptr`. If set to `nullptr`, constant @p beta is used
 * instead.
 * @param katz_centralities Pointer to the output Katz Centrality score array.
 * @param alpha Katz Centrality attenuation factor. This should be smaller than the inverse of the
 * maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of @p graph.
 * @param beta Constant value to be added to each vertex's new Katz Centrality score in every
 * iteration. Relevant only when @p betas is `nullptr`.
 * @param epsilon Error tolerance to check convergence. Convergence is assuemd if the sum of the
 * differences in Katz Centrality values between two consecutive iterations is less than the number
 * of vertices in the graph multiplied by @p epsilon.
 * @param max_iterations Maximum number of Katz Centrality iterations.
 * @param has_initial_guess If set to `true`, values in the Katz Centrality output array (pointed by
 * @p katz_centralities) is used as initial Katz Centrality values. If false, zeros are used as
 * initial Katz Centrality values.
 * @param normalize If set to `true`, final Katz Centrality scores are normalized (the L2-norm of
 * the returned Katz Centrality score array is 1.0) before returning.
 * @param do_expensive_check A flag to run expensive checks for input arguments (if set to `true`).
