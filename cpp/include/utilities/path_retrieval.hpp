 * @tparam vertex_t Type of vertex identifiers. Needs to be an integral type.
 * @tparam weight_t Type of edge weights. Needs to be a floating point type.
 * @param handle RAFT handle object to encapsulate resources (e.g. CUDA stream, communicator, and
 * handles to various CUDA libraries) to run graph algorithms. Must have at least one worker stream.
 * @param vertices Pointer to vertex ids.
 * @param preds Pointer to predecessors.
 * @param info_weights Secondary weights along the edge from predecessor to vertex.
 * @param out Contains for each index the sum of weights along the path unfolding.
 * @param num_vertices Number of vertices.
