/**
 * @brief     Find the PageRank vertex values for a graph.
 *
 * cuGraph computes an approximation of the Pagerank eigenvector using the power method.
 * The number of iterations depends on the properties of the network itself; it increases
 * when the tolerance descreases and/or alpha increases toward the limiting value of 1.
 * The user is free to use default values or to provide inputs for the initial guess,
 * tolerance and maximum number of iterations.
 *
 * @throws                           cugraph::logic_error with a custom message when an error
 occurs.
 *
 * @tparam VT                        Type of vertex identifiers. Supported value : int (signed,
 32-bit)
 * @tparam ET                        Type of edge identifiers. Supported value : int (signed,
 32-bit)
 * @tparam WT                        Type of edge weights. Supported value : float or double.
 *
 * @param[in] graph                  cuGRAPH graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity
 information as a transposed adjacency list (CSC). Edge weights are not used for this algorithm.
 * @param[in] alpha                  The damping factor alpha represents the probability to follow
 an outgoing edge, standard value is 0.85. Thus, 1.0-alpha is the probability to “teleport” to a
 random vertex. Alpha should be greater than 0.0 and strictly lower than 1.0.
 *                                   The initial guess must not be the vector of 0s. Any value other
 than 1 or 0 is treated as an invalid value.
 * @param[in] pagerank               Array of size V. Should contain the initial guess if
 has_guess=true. In this case the initial guess cannot be the vector of 0s. Memory is provided and
 owned by the caller.
 * @param[in] personalization_subset_size (optional) The number of vertices for to personalize.
 Initialized to 0 by default.
 * @param[in] personalization_subset (optional) Array of size personalization_subset_size containing
 vertices for running personalized pagerank. Initialized to nullptr by default. Memory is provided
 and owned by the caller.
 * @param[in] personalization_values (optional) Array of size personalization_subset_size containing
 values associated with personalization_subset vertices. Initialized to nullptr by default. Memory
 is provided and owned by the caller.
 * @param[in] tolerance              Set the tolerance the approximation, this parameter should be a
 small magnitude value.
 *                                   The lower the tolerance the better the approximation. If this
 value is 0.0f, cuGRAPH will use the default value which is 1.0E-5.
 *                                   Setting too small a tolerance can lead to non-convergence due
 to numerical roundoff. Usually values between 0.01 and 0.00001 are acceptable.
 * @param[in] max_iter               (optional) The maximum number of iterations before an answer is
 returned. This can be used to limit the execution time and do an early exit before the solver
 reaches the convergence tolerance.
 *                                   If this value is lower or equal to 0 cuGRAPH will use the
 default value, which is 500.
 * @param[in] has_guess              (optional) This parameter is used to notify cuGRAPH if it
 should use a user-provided initial guess. False means the user does not have a guess, in this case
 cuGRAPH will use a uniform vector set to 1/V.
 *                                   If the value is True, cuGRAPH will read the pagerank parameter
 and use this as an initial guess.
 * @param[out] *pagerank             The PageRank : pagerank[i] is the PageRank of vertex i. Memory
 remains provided and owned by the caller.

 * @throws     cugraph::logic_error with a custom message when an error occurs.
 *
 * @tparam VT                        Type of vertex identifiers. Supported value : int (signed,
 * 32-bit)
 * @tparam ET                        Type of edge identifiers.  Supported value : int (signed,
 * 32-bit)
 * @tparam WT                        Type of edge weights. Supported values : int (signed, 32-bit)
 *
 * @param[in] graph                  cuGRAPH graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity
 * information as a CSR
 *
 * @param[out] distances            If set to a valid column, this is populated by distance of every
 * vertex in the graph from the starting vertex
 *
 * @param[out] predecessors         If set to a valid column, this is populated by bfs traversal
 * predecessor of every vertex
 *
 * @param[in] start_vertex           The starting vertex for breadth first search traversal
 *
 * @param[in] directed               Treat the input graph as directed
 *
 * @throws     cugraph::logic_error when an error occurs.
