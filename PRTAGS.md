PR = Pull Request

|  TAG       |                                                       |

| WIP        | _Work In Progress_ - Within the RAPIDS cuGraph team, we try to open a PR when development starts.  This allows other to review code as it is being developed and provide feedback before too much code needs to be refactored.  It also allows process to be tracked |
| skip-ci    | _Do Not Run CI_ - This flag prevents CI from being run.  It is good practice to include this with the **WIP** tag since code is typically not at a point where it will pass CI.  |
| skip ci    | same as above                                          |
| API-REVIEW | This tag request a code review just of the API portion of the code - This is benificial to ensure that all required arguments are captured.  Doing this early can save from having to refactor later. |
| REVIEW     | The code is ready for a full code review.  Only code that has passed a code review is merged into the baseline  |
