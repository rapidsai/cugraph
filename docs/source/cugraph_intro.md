# cuGraph Introduction

## Terminology

The field of graph analytics (network science) is really a merge of
multiple fields, each with its own argot (jargon).  Graph Theory from
Mathematics uses the terms vertex and edge, while social network analysis
from sociology uses node and edge.  In the cuGraph documentation, we will
bounce between the two sets of term.  In the Python layer, we will mostly
use the terms __Node__ and __Edge__ or __Link_ to better match NetworkX preferred term
use, as well as other Python-based tools.  At the CUDA/C layer, we favor the
mathematical terms of __Vertex__ and __Edge__.
