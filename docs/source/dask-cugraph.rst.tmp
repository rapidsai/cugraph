Multi-GPU with cuGraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cuGraph supports multi-GPU leveraging `Dask <https://dask.org>`_. Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python which makes scaling out your workflow smooth and simple. cuGraph also uses other Dask-based RAPIDS projects such as `dask-cuda <https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-cuda>`_.

The current solution is able to scale across multiple GPUs on a multiple machines. Distributing the graph and computation lets you analyze datasets far larger than a single GPU’s memory.

With cuGraph and Dask, whether you’re using a single NVIDIA GPU or using all 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs on a DGX-2, your RAPIDS workflow will run smoothly, intelligently distributing the workload across the available resources.

When to Use Multiple GPUs in cuGraph
====================================

If your graph comfortably fits in memory on a single GPU, you would want to use the single-GPU version of cuGraph. If you want to distribute your workflow across multiple GPUs and have more data than you can fit in memory on a single GPU, you would want to use cuGraph's multi-GPU features.
