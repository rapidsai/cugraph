# Getting the WholeGraph Packages

There are 4 ways to get WholeGraph packages:
1. [Quick start with Docker Repo](#docker)
2. [Conda Installation](#conda)
3. [Pip Installation](#pip)
4. [Build from Source](./source_build.md)

## Docker
The RAPIDS Docker containers (as of Release 23.10) contain all RAPIDS packages, including WholeGraph, as well as all required supporting packages.   To download a container, please see the [Docker Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/), choosing a tag based on the NVIDIA CUDA version youâ€™re running.  This provides a ready to run Docker container with example notebooks and data, showcasing how you can utilize all of the RAPIDS libraries.
