 > **1. Is `nx-cugraph` able to run across multiple GPUs?**

nx-cugraph currently does not support multi-GPU. Multi-GPU support may be added to a future release of nx-cugraph, but consider [cugraph](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/stable) for multi-GPU accelerated graph analytics in Python today.
