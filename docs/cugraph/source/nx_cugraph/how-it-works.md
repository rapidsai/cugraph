# How it Works

NetworkX has the ability to **dispatch function calls to separately-installed third-party backends**.

NetworkX backends let users experience improved performance and/or additional functionality without changing their NetworkX Python code. Examples include backends that provide algorithm acceleration using GPUs, parallel processing, graph database integration, and more.

While NetworkX is a pure-Python implementation, backends may be written to use other libraries and even specialized hardware. `nx-cugraph` is a NetworkX backend that uses RAPIDS cuGraph and NVIDIA GPUs to significantly improve NetworkX performance.

## Enabling nx-cugraph

It is recommended to use `networkx>=3.4` for optimal zero code change performance, but `nx-cugraph` will also work with `networkx 3.0+`.

NetworkX will use `nx-cugraph` as the backend if any of the following are used:

### `NX_CUGRAPH_AUTOCONFIG` environment variable.

The `NX_CUGRAPH_AUTOCONFIG` environment variable can be used to configure NetworkX for full zero code change acceleration using `nx-cugraph`.  If a NetworkX function is called that `nx-cugraph` supports, NetworkX will redirect the function call to `nx-cugraph` automatically, or fall back to either another backend if enabled or the default NetworkX implementation. See the [NetworkX documentation on backends](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/backends.html) for configuring NetworkX manually.

```
bash> NX_CUGRAPH_AUTOCONFIG=True python my_networkx_script.py
```

### `backend=` keyword argument

To explicitly specify a particular backend for an API, use the `backend=`
keyword argument. This argument takes precedence over the
`NX_CUGRAPH_AUTOCONFIG` environment variable. This requires anyone
running code that uses the `backend=` keyword argument to have the specified
backend installed.

Example:
```python
nx.betweenness_centrality(cit_patents_graph, k=k, backend="cugraph")
```

### Type-based dispatching

NetworkX also supports automatically dispatching to backends associated with
specific graph types. Like the `backend=` keyword argument example above, this
requires the user to write code for a specific backend, and therefore requires
the backend to be installed, but has the advantage of ensuring a particular
behavior without the potential for runtime conversions.

To use type-based dispatching with `nx-cugraph`, the user must import the backend
directly in their code to access the utilities provided to create a Graph
instance specifically for the `nx-cugraph` backend.

Example:
```python
import networkx as nx
import nx_cugraph as nxcg

G = nx.Graph()

# populate the graph
#  ...

nxcg_G = nxcg.from_networkx(G)             # conversion happens once here
nx.betweenness_centrality(nxcg_G, k=1000)  # nxcg Graph type causes cugraph backend
                                           # to be used, no conversion necessary
```

## Command Line Example

---

Create `bc_demo.ipy` and paste the code below.

```python
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx

url = "https://data.rapids.ai/cugraph/datasets/cit-Patents.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=" ", names=["src", "dst"], dtype="int32")
G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, source="src", target="dst")

%time result = nx.betweenness_centrality(G, k=10)
```
Run the command:
```
user@machine:/# ipython bc_demo.ipy

CPU times: user 7min 36s, sys: 5.22 s, total: 7min 41s
Wall time: 7min 41s
```

You will observe a run time of approximately 7 minutes...more or less depending on your CPU.

Run the command again, this time specifying cugraph as the NetworkX backend.
```bash
user@machine:/# NX_CUGRAPH_AUTOCONFIG=True ipython bc_demo.ipy

CPU times: user 4.14 s, sys: 1.13 s, total: 5.27 s
Wall time: 5.32 s
```
This run will be much faster, typically around 5 seconds depending on your GPU.
