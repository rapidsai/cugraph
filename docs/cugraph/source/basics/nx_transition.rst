compatibility issues*

Latest Update
#############

Last Update:	March 7th, 2024
Release:		24.04

**CuGraph is now a registered backend for networkX. This is described in the following blog:
`Accelerating NetworkX on NVIDIA GPUs for High Performance Graph Analytics
<https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-networkx-on-nvidia-gpus-for-high-performance-graph-analytics/>`_


Easy Path – Use NetworkX Graph Objects, Accelerated Algorithms
##############################################################

Rather than updating all of your existing code, simply update the calls to
graph algorithms by replacing the module name.  This allows all the complicated
ETL code to be unchanged while still seeing significate performance
improvements. Again this will be deprecated since networkX dispatching to nx_cugraph
has many advantages.

It is that easy.  All algorithms in cuGraph support a NetworkX graph object as
input and match the NetworkX API list of arguments.

Currently, cuGraph accepts both NetworkX Graph and DiGraph objects. We will be
adding support for Bipartite graph and Multigraph over the next few releases.

Differences in Algorithms
##########################

Since cuGraph currently does not support attribute rich graphs, those
algorithms that return simple scores (centrality, clustering, etc.) best match
the NetworkX process.  Algorithms that return a subgraph will do so without
any additional attributes on the nodes or edges.

For example, the NetworkX traversal algorithms typically return a generator
rather than a dictionary.

Graph Building
##############

The biggest difference between NetworkX and cuGraph is with how Graph objects
are built. NetworkX, for the most part, stores graph data in a dictionary.
That structure allows easy insertion of new records. Consider the following
code for building a NetworkX Graph::

    # Read the node data
    df = pd.read_csv( data_file)

    # Construct graph from edge list.
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    for row in df.iterrows():
        G.add_edge(
            row[1]["1"], row[1]["2"], count=row[1]["3"]
        )


The code block is perfectly fine for NetworkX. However, the process of iterating over the dataframe and adding one node at a time is problematic for GPUs and something that we try and avoid.  cuGraph stores data in columns (i.e. arrays).  Resizing an array requires allocating a new array one element larger, copying the data, and adding the new value.  That is not very efficient.

If your code follows the above model of inserting one element at a time, the we suggest either rewriting that code or using it as is within NetworkX and just accelerating the algorithms with cuGraph.

Now, if your code bulk loads the data from Pandas, then RAPIDS can accelerate that process by orders of magnitude.

The above cuGraph code will create cuGraph.Graph object and not a NetworkX.Graph object.
