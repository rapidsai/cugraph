NetworkX Compatibility and Transition
**************************************

*Note: this is a work in progress and will be updatred and changed as we better flesh out 
compatibility issues*

One of the goals of RAPIDS cuGraph is to mimic the NetworkX API to simplify
the transition to accelerated GPU data science.  However, graph analysis,
also called network science, like most other data science workflow, is more
than just running an algorithm.  Graph data requires cleaning and prep (ETL)
and then the construction of a graph object; that is all before the execution
of a graph algorithm.  RAPIDS and cuGraph allow a portion or the complete
analytic workflow to be accelerated.  To achieve the maximum amount of
acceleration, we encourage fully replacing existing code with cuGraph.
But sometimes it is easier to replace just a portion.

Easy Path – Use NetworkX Graph Objects, Accelerated Algorithms
##############################################################

Rather than updating all of your existing code, simply update the calls to
graph algorithms by replacing the module name.  This allows all the complicated
ETL code to be unchanged while still seeing significate performance
improvements.  

In the following example, the cuGraph module is being imported as “cnx”.
While module can be assigned any name can be used, we picked cnx to reduce
the amount of text to be changed. The text highlighted in yellow indicates
changes.

It is that easy.  All algorithms in cuGraph support a NetworkX graph object as
input and match the NetworkX API list of arguments.  

Currently, cuGraph accepts both NetworkX Graph and DiGraph objects. We will be
adding support for Bipartite graph and Multigraph over the next few releases.

Differences in Algorithms
##########################

Since cuGraph currently does not support attribute rich graphs, those
algorithms that return simple scores (centrality, clustering, etc.) best match
the NetworkX process.  Algorithms that return a subgraph will do so without
any additional attributes on the nodes or edges.

Graph Building
##############

The biggest difference between NetworkX and cuGraph is with how Graph objects
are built.  NetworkX, for the most part, stores graph data in a dictionary.
That structure allows easy insertion of new records.    Consider the following
code for building a NetworkX Graph::

    # Read the node data
    df = pd.read_csv( data_file)

    # Construct graph from edge list.
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    for row in df.iterrows():
        G.add_edge(
            row[1]["1"], row[1]["2"], count=row[1]["3"]
        )


The code block is perfectly fine for NetworkX. However, the process of iterating over the dataframe and adding one node at a time is problematic for GPUs and something that we try and avoid.  cuGraph stores data in columns (i.e. arrays).  Resizing an array requires allocating a new array one element larger, copying the data, and adding the new value.  That is not very efficient.  

If your code follows the above model of inserting one element at a time, the we suggest either rewriting that code or using it as is within NetworkX and just accelerating the algorithms with cuGraph.  

Now, if your code bulk loads the data from Pandas, then RAPIDS can accelerate that process by orders of magnitude.

The above cuGraph code will create cuGraph.Graph object and not a NetworkX.Graph object.
