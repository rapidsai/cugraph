Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
cuGraph is a library of graph algorithms that seamlessly integrates into the
RAPIDS data science ecosystem and allows the data scientist to easily call
graph algorithms using data stored in GPU DataFrames, NetworkX Graphs, or
even CuPy or SciPy sparse Matrices.

Note: We are redoing all of our documents, please be patient as we update
the docs and links
