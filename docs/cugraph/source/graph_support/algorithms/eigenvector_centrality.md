# Eigenvector Centrality

Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a vertex based on the
centrality of its neighbors. The Eigenvector of a node measures influence within a graph by taking into account a vertex's connections to other highly connected vertices.


See [Eigenvector Centrality on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality) for more details on the algorithm.

The eigenvector centrality for node i is the
i-th element of the vector x defined by the eigenvector equation.

Where M(v) is the adjacency list for the set of vertices(v) and Î» is a constant.

## When to use Eigenvector Centrality
* When the quality and quantity of edges matters, in other words, connections to other high-degree nodes is important
* To calculate influence in nuanced networks like social and financial networks. 

## When not to use Eigenvector Centrality
* in graphs with many disconnected groups
* in graphs containing many distinct and different communities 
* in networks with negative weights
* in huge networks eigenvector centrality can become computationally infeasible in single threaded systems.


## How computationally expensive is it?
While cuGraph's parallelism migigates run time, [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is still the standard to compare algorithm costs.

O(VE) where V is the number of vertices(nodes) and Eis the number of edges.
