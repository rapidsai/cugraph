# Betweenness Centrality (BC)

Betweenness centrality is a measure of the relative importance based on measuring the number of shortest paths that pass through each vertex or over each edge.  High betweenness centrality vertices have a greater number of path cross through the vertex.  Likewise, high centrality edges have more shortest paths that pass over the edge.

See [Betweenness on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality) for more details on the algorithm.

Betweenness centrality of a node ùë£ is the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through ùë£

$c_B(v) =\sum_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}$


## When to use BC
Betweenness centrality is often used to answer questions like:
* Which vertices are most influential in the network?
* What are the bridge vertices in a network?
* How robust/redundant is the network?
* In a social network analysis, betweenness centrality can be used to identify roles in an organization.

## When not to use BC
Betweenness Centrality is less efficient in certain circumstances:
* Large graphs may require approximationing betweenness centrality as the computational cost increases.
* Disconnected networks or networks with many isolated components limit the value of betweenness centrality
* Betweenness centality is more costly and less useful in weighted graphs.
* In networks with hierarchical structure, BC might not accurately reflect true influence
* Networks with multiple edge types often require a seperate method of measuring influence for each edge type.


## How computationally expensive is BC?
While cuGraph's parallelism migigates run time, [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is still the standard to compare algorithm costs.
* The cost is  O(V(E+V)) for a non-weighted graph and O(V(E+V)log(V)) for a weighted graph.
* A breadth-first search is done to determine shortest paths betweeb all nodes prior to calculating BC.
