    "### Approach\n",
    "A simple approach to creating a cost matrix is to run All-Source Shortest Path (ASSP), however cuGraph currently does not have an All-Source Shortest Path (ASSP) algorithm.  One is on the roadmap, based on Floyd-Warshall, but that doesn't help us today. Luckily there is a work around if the graph to be processed is small.  The hack is to run ASSP by creating a lot of copies of the graph and running the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) on one seed per graph copy. Since each SSSP run within its own disjoint component, there is no issue with path collisions between seeds.  \n"
