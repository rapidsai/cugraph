    "\n",
    "Subgraph Extraction allows the extraction of a portion of a graph and returned as a Graph object that follow-on analytics can be applied against.  For example, many of the community detection analytics simply return a list of vertices in a cluster.  In order to run follow-on processing against a cluster, all the edges within that cluster are also needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will run Louvain to determine the clusters and then extract one of the clusters using Subgraph Extraction.  We will then explore that extracted subgraph.  \n",

    "#### Some notes about vertex IDs...\n",
    "* The current version of cuGraph requires that vertex IDs be representable as 32-bit integers, meaning graphs currently can contain at most 2^32 unique vertex IDs. However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
    "  * For more advanced renumbering support, see the examples in `structure/renumber.ipynb` and `structure/renumber-2.ipynb`\n"
