    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Louvain method of community detection is a greedy heirarical clsutering algorithm which seeks to optimize Modularity as it progresses. Louvain starts with each vertex in its own clusters and iteratively merges groups using graph contraction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of the algorithm see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes as input a cugraph.Graph object and returns as output a \n",
    "cudf.Dataframe object with the id and assigned partition for each \n",
    "vertex as well as the final modularity score\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Louvain cluster in cuGraph use: <br>\n",
    "   __df, mod  = cugraph.louvain(G)__\n",

    "        as an edge list. The adjacency list will be computed if not already present.\n",
    "        The graph should be undirected where an undirected edge is represented by a\n",
    "        directed edge in both direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    max_iter : integer\n",
    "        This controls the maximum number of levels/iterations of the Louvain\n",
    "        algorithm. When specified the algorithm will terminate after no more\n",
    "        than the specified number of iterations. No error occurs when the\n",

    "## cuGraph Notice \n",
    "The current version of cuGraph has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vertex IDs need to be 32-bit integers.\n",
    "* Vertex IDs are expected to be contiguous integers starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "cuGraph provides the renumber function to mitigate this problem. Input vertex IDs for the renumber function can be either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, can be non-contiguous, and can start from an arbitrary number. The renumber function maps the provided input vertex IDs to 32-bit contiguous integers starting from 0. cuGraph still requires the renumbered vertex IDs to be representable in 32-bit integers. These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed soon.    "
