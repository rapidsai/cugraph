    "## Louvain Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Louvain method of community detection is a greedy hierarchical clustering algorithm which seeks to optimize Modularity as it progresses. Louvain starts with each vertex in its own clusters and iteratively merges groups using graph contraction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of the algorithm see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes as input a cugraph.Graph object and returns as output a \n",
    "cudf.Dataframe object with the id and assigned partition for each \n",
    "vertex as well as the final modularity score\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Louvain cluster in cuGraph use: <br>\n",
    "   __df, mod  = cugraph.louvain(G, max_iter = 100)__\n",

    "    ----------\n",
    "    input_graph : cugraph.Graph\n",
    "        cuGraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information\n",
    "        as an edge list. The adjacency list will be computed if not already present.\n",
    "        The graph should be undirected where an undirected edge is represented by a\n",
    "        directed edge in both direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    max_iter : integer\n",
    "        This controls the maximum number of levels/iterations of the Louvain\n",
    "        algorithm. When specified the algorithm will terminate after no more\n",
    "        than the specified number of iterations. No error occurs when the\n",
    "        algorithm terminates early in this manner.\n",

    "        A GPU data frame of size V containing two columns the vertex id and the\n",

    "#### Note\n",
    "Parallel Louvain produces different modularity scores that serial Louvain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serial Louvain is a greedy method that iterates over the vertices in numerical order and\n",
    "evaluates whether to move a vertex into a different cluster and then moves it if\n",
    "modularity is increased.  After considering all vertices in serial it computes a new\n",
    "modularity score and if better than the last clustering it will repeat.  If vertex i is\n",
    "moved to a new cluster, and vertex j is a neighbor of vertex i and is processed after\n",
    "vertex i, then vertex j will compute its delta modularity based on the vertex i's new\n",
    "cluster assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Louvain computes delta modularity for all vertex/cluster combinations and chooses\n",
    "the best change for ALL vertices in parallel.  This means that vertex i and vertex j being\n",
    "neighbors (as above), both will see the old cluster assignment for that vertex.  This will result\n",
    "in different decisions being made between the parallel and serial versions.  Because Louvain\n",
    "is a greedy method, those decisions might lead the algorithms to converge on different local\n",
    "maximums.\n",

    "#### Some notes about vertex IDs...\n",
    "* The current version of cuGraph requires that vertex IDs be representable as 32-bit integers, meaning graphs currently can contain at most 2^32 unique vertex IDs. However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
    "  * For more advanced renumbering support, see the examples in `structure/renumber.ipynb` and `structure/renumber-2.ipynb`\n"
