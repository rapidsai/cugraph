    "_Weakly connected component_ (WCC) is often a necessary pre-processing step for many graph algorithms. A dataset may contact several disconnected (sub-) graphs.  Quite often, running a graph algorithm only on one component of a disconnected graph can lead to bugs which are not easy to trace.\n",

    "### Some notes about vertex IDs...\n",
    "* The current version of cuGraph requires that vertex IDs be representable as 32-bit integers, meaning graphs currently can contain at most 2^32 unique vertex IDs. However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
    "  * For more advanced renumbering support, see the examples in `structure/renumber.ipynb` and `structure/renumber-2.ipynb`\n"
