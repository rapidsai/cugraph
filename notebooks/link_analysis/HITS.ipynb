    "## Introduction\n",
    "HITS, also known as hubs and authorities, computes the relative importance of vertices.   \n",
    "\n",
    "See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) for more details on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "HITS can be thought of as similar to PageRank, it is an iterative algorithm that propagates scores until a tolerance is reached, or max number of iterations is processed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "From Wikepedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm performs a series of iterations, each consisting of two basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Authority__ update: Update each node's authority score to be equal to the sum of the hub scores of each node that points to it. That is, a node is given a high authority score by being linked from pages that are recognized as Hubs for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hub__ update: Update each node's hub score to be equal to the sum of the authority scores of each node that it points to. That is, a node is given a high hub score by linking to nodes that are considered to be authorities on the subject.\n",

    "### Some notes about vertex IDs...\n",
    "* The current version of cuGraph requires that vertex IDs be representable as 32-bit integers, meaning graphs currently can contain at most 2^32 unique vertex IDs. However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
    "  * For more advanced renumbering support, see the examples in `structure/renumber.ipynb` and `structure/renumber-2.ipynb`\n"
