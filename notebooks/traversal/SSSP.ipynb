    "\n",
    "Single source shortest path computes the shortest paths from the given starting vertex to all other reachable vertices. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute SSSP for a graph in cuGraph we use:\n",
    "**cugraph.sssp(G, source)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "* __G__: cugraph.Graph object\n",
    "* __source__: int, Index of the source vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns \n",
    "* __df__:  a cudf.DataFrame object with two columns:\n",
    "    * df['vertex']: The vertex identifier for the vertex\n",
    "    * df['distance']: The computed distance from the source vertex to this vertex\n",
    "    * df['predecessor']: The predecessor vertex along this paths.  Allows paths to be recreated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## cuGraph Notice \n",
    "The current version of cuGraph has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vertex IDs need to be 32-bit integers.\n",
    "* Vertex IDs are expected to be contiguous integers starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "cuGraph provides the renumber function to mitigate this problem. Input vertex IDs for the renumber function can be either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, can be non-contiguous, and can start from an arbitrary number. The renumber function maps the provided input vertex IDs to 32-bit contiguous integers starting from 0. cuGraph still requires the renumbered vertex IDs to be representable in 32-bit integers. These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed soon."
