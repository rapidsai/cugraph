    "Single source shortest path computes the shortest paths from the given starting vertex to all other reachable vertices. \n",

    "To compute SSSP for a graph in cuGraph we use:\n",
    "**cugraph.sssp(G, source)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "* __G__: cugraph.Graph object\n",
    "* __source__: int, Index of the source vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns \n",
    "* __df__:  a cudf.DataFrame object with two columns:\n",
    "    * df['vertex']: The vertex identifier for the vertex\n",
    "    * df['distance']: The computed distance from the source vertex to this vertex\n",
    "    * df['predecessor']: The predecessor vertex along this paths.  Allows paths to be recreated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes about vertex IDs...\n",
    "* The current version of cuGraph requires that vertex IDs be representable as 32-bit integers, meaning graphs currently can contain at most 2^32 unique vertex IDs. However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
    "  * For more advanced renumbering support, see the examples in `structure/renumber.ipynb` and `structure/renumber-2.ipynb`\n"
