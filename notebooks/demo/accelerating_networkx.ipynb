        "# NetworkX - Easy Graph Analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "NetworkX is the most popular library for graph analytics available in Python, or quite possibly any language. To illustrate this, NetworkX was downloaded more than 71 million times in September of 2024 alone, which is roughly 71 times more than the next most popular graph analytics library! [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkX) NetworkX has earned this popularity from its very easy-to-use API, the wealth of documentation and examples available, the large (and friendly) community behind it, and its easy installation which requires nothing more than Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, NetworkX users are familiar with the tradeoff that comes with those benefits. The pure-Python implementation often results in poor performance when graph data starts to reach larger scales, limiting the usefulness of the library for many real-world problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accelerated NetworkX - Easy (and fast!) Graph Analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "To address the performance problem, NetworkX 3.0 introduced a mechanism to dispatch algorithm calls to alternate implementations. The NetworkX Python API remains the same but NetworkX will use more capable algorithm implementations provided by one or more backends. This approach means users don't have to give up NetworkX -or even change their code- in order to take advantage of GPU performance."
