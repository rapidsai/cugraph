# cuGraph Centrality Notebooks

![GraphAnalyticsFigure](../img/zachary_graph_centrality.png)

Centrality notebooks contain a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate various algorithms to identify and quantify importance of nodes to the structure of the graph.  In the diagram above, the highlighted nodes are highly important to the graph structure. But which is most important? The answer depends on which measure/algorithm is run.  Manipulation of the data before or after the graph analytic is not covered here.   Extended, more problem focused, notebooks are being created and available https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks-extended

## Summary



## RAPIDS notebooks
Visit the main RAPIDS [notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks) repo for a listing of all notebooks across all RAPIDS libraries.

## Requirements

Running the example in these notebooks requires:

* The latest version of RAPIDS with cuGraph.
  * Download via Docker, Conda (See [__Getting Started__](https://rapids.ai/start.html))
