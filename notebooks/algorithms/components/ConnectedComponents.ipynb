    "_Weakly connected component_ (WCC) is often a necessary pre-processing step for many graph algorithms. A dataset may contact several disconnected (sub-) graphs.  Quite often, running a graph algorithm only on one component of a disconnected graph can lead to bugs which are not easy to trace.\n",
