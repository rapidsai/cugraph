    "One of the most common types of vertex similarity is to evaluate the neighborhood of vertex pairs and looks at the number of common neighbors.  TThat type of similar comes from statistics and is based on set comparison.  Both Jaccard and the Overlap Coefficient operate on sets, and in a graph setting, those sets are the list of neighboring vertices. <br>\n",
    "For those that like math:  The neighbors of a vertex, _v_, is defined as the set, _U_, of vertices connected by way of an edge to vertex v, or _N(v) = {U} where v ∈ V and ∀ u ∈ U ∃ edge(v,u)∈ E_.\n",
