    "The Ensemble Clustering for Graphs (ECG) method of community detection is based on the Louvain algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of the algorithm see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05578\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes as input a cugraph.Graph object and returns as output a \n",
    "cudf.Dataframe object with the id and assigned partition for each \n",
    "vertex as well as the final modularity score\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the ECG cluster in cuGraph use: <br>\n",

    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
