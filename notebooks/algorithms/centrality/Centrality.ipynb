From a social network perspective, the question is who do you seek for an answer and then who does that person seek.  PageRank is good when there is implied importance in the data, for example a citation network, web page linkages, or trust networks. Pagerank also dilutes the importance of nodes which have exceedingly high outward degree which is an improvement over Katz.\n",
