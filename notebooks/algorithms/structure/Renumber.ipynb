    "\n",
    "Under the covers, cuGraph represents a graph as a matrix in Compressed Sparse Row format (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix).  The problem with a matrix representation is that there is a column and row for every possible vertex ID.  Therefore, if the data contains vertex IDs that are non-contiguous, or which start at a large initial value, then there is a lot of empty space that uses up memory.      \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative case is using renumbering to convert from one data type down to a contiguous sequence of integer IDs.  This is useful when the dataset contain vertex IDs that are not integers.  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate creating a graph with renumbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cuGraph algorithms operate on a CSR representation of a graph.  A CSR representation requires an indices array that is as long as the number of edges and an offsets array that is as 1 more than the largest vertex id.  This makes the memory utilization entirely dependent on the size of the largest vertex id.  For data sets that have a sparse range of vertex ids, the size of the CSR can be unnecessarily large.  It is easy to construct an example where the amount of memory required for the offsets array will exceed the amount of memory in the GPU (not to mention the performance cost of having a large number of offsets that are empty but still have to be read to be skipped).\n",
    "\n",
    "The renumbering feature allows us to generate unique identifiers for every vertex identified in the input data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Renumbering can happen automatically as part of graph generation.  It can also be done explicitly by the caller, this notebook will provide examples using both techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental requirement for the user of the renumbering software is to specify how to identify a vertex.  We will refer to this as the *external* vertex identifier.  This will typically be done by specifying a cuDF DataFrame, and then identifying which columns within the DataFrame constitute source vertices and which columns specify destination columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider that a vertex is uniquely defined as a tuple of elements from the rows of a cuDF DataFrame.  The primary restriction is that the number of elements in the tuple must be the same for both source vertices and destination vertices, and that the types of each element in the source tuple must be the same as the corresponding element in the destination tuple.  This restriction is a natural restriction and should be obvious why this is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Renumbering takes the collection of tuples that uniquely identify vertices in the graph, eliminates duplicates, and assigns integer identifiers to the unique tuples.  These integer identifiers are used as *internal* vertex identifiers within the cuGraph software.\n"
