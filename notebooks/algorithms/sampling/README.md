<img src="../../img/zachary_black_lines.png" width="35%"/>

CuGraph Sampling notebooks begin to address graph problems solved by random or other methods of sampling.
These algorithms will solve problems like:

* How to collect uniform samples from a large graph
* Scaling down a large known graph
* Exploring a huge unknown graph
