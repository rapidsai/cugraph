    "\n",
    "One of the most common types of vertex similarity is to evaluate the neighborhood of vertex pairs and looks at the number of common neighbors.  TThat type of similar comes from statistics and is based on set comparison.  Both Jaccard and the Overlap Coefficient operate on sets, and in a graph setting, those sets are the list of neighboring vertices. <br>\n",
    "For those that like math:  The neighbors of a vertex, _v_, is defined as the set, _U_, of vertices connected by way of an edge to vertex v, or _N(v) = {U} where v ∈ V and ∀ u ∈ U ∃ edge(v,u)∈ E_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this introduction, set __A__ will equate to _A = N(i)_ and set __B__ will quate to _B = N(j)_.  That just make the rest of the text more readable."

However, this limitation is being actively addressed and a version of cuGraph that accommodates more than 2^32 vertices will be available in the near future.\n",
    "* cuGraph will automatically renumber graphs to an internal format consisting of a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, and convert back to the original IDs when returning data to the caller. If the vertex IDs of the data are already a contiguous series of integers starting from 0, the auto-renumbering step can be skipped for faster graph creation times.\n",
    "  * To skip auto-renumbering, set the `renumber` boolean arg to `False` when calling the appropriate graph creation API (eg. `G.from_cudf_edgelist(gdf_r, source='src', destination='dst', renumber=False)`).\n",
