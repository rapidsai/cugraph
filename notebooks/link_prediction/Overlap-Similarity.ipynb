    "## Introduction - Common Neighbor Similarity \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common types of vertex similarity is to evaluate the neighborhood of vertex pairs and looks at the number of common neighbors.  TThat type of similar comes from statistics and is based on set comparison.  Both Jaccard and the Overlap Coefficient operate on sets, and in a graph setting, those sets are the list of neighboring vertices. <br>\n",
    "For those that like math:  The neighbors of a vertex, _v_, is defined as the set, _U_, of vertices connected by way of an edge to vertex v, or _N(v) = {U} where v ∈ V and ∀ u ∈ U ∃ edge(v,u)∈ E_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this introduction, set __A__ will equate to _A = N(i)_ and set __B__ will quate to _B = N(j)_.  That just make the rest of the text more readable."

Input vertex IDs for the renumber function can be either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, can be non-contiguous, and can start from an arbitrary number. The renumber function maps the provided input vertex IDs to 32-bit contiguous integers starting from 0. cuGraph still requires the renumbered vertex IDs to be representable in 32-bit integers. These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed soon."
