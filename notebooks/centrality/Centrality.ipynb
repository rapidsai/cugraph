    "Centrality is measure of how important, or central, a node or edge is within a graph.  It is useful for identifying influencer in social networks, key routing nodes in communication/computer network infrastructures, \n",

    "Closeness is a measure of the shortest path to every other node in the graph.  A node that is close to every other node, can reach over other node in the fewest number of hops, means that it has greater influence on the network versus a node that is not close.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Betweenness Centrality__ <br>\n",
    "Betweenness is a measure of the number of shortest paths that cross through a node, or over an edge.  A node with high betweenness means that it had a greater influence on the flow of information.  \n",

    "To speedup runtime of betweenness centrailty, the metric can be computed on a limited number of nodes (randomly selected) and then used to estimate the other scores.  For this example, the graphs are relatively small (under 5,000 nodes) so betweenness on every node will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Eigenvector Centrality - coming soon___ <br>\n",
    "Eigenvectors can be thought of as the balancing points of a graph, or center of gravity of a 3D object.  High centrality means that more of the graph is balanced around that node.\n",

    "Katz is a variant of degree centrality and of eigenvector centrality. \n",

From a social network perspective, the question is who do you seek for an answer and then who does that person seek.  PageRank is good when there is implied importance in the data, for example a citation network, web page linkages, or trust networks.    \n"
