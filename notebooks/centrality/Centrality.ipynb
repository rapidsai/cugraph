    "Centrality is measure of how important, or central, a node or edge is with a graph.   It is useful for identifying influencer in social networks, key routing nodes in communication/computer network infrastructures, \n",
    "\n",
    "The seminal paper on centrality is:  Freeman, L. C. (1978). Centrality in social networks conceptual clarification. Social networks, 1(3), 215-239.\n",

    "__Degree centrality ‚Äì coming soon but there is a work around__ <br>\n",
    "Degree centrality is based on the notion that whoever has the most connects must be important.   \n",
    "We can use the degree function until a centrality wrapper is added\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    Cd(v) = degree(v)\n",

    "__Closeness centrality ‚Äì coming soon__ <br>\n",
    "Closeness is a measure of the shortest path to every other node in the graph.  A node that is close to every other node means that it has greater influence on the network over a node that is not close (high centrality score)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Betweenness Centrality__ <br>\n",
    "Betweenness is a measure of the number of shortest paths that cross through a vertex, or over an edge.  A node with high betweenness means that it controls the flow of more information.  \n",

    "</center>\n",

    "To speedup runtime of betweenness centrailty, the metric can be computed for a limited number of seed and then used to estimate the other scores.  For this example, the graphs are relatively smalled (under 5,000 vertices) so betweenness on every vertice will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Eigenvector Centrality - comming soon__ <br>\n",
    "I like to think of Eigenvectors as the balancing points of a graph, or center of gravity of a 3D object.  High centrality means that more of the graph is balanced around that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Katz Centrality__ <br>\n",
    "Katz is a variant of degree centrality and of eigenvector centrality. \n",

    "PageRank is classified as both a Link Analysis tool and a centrality measure.  PageRank is based on the assumption that important nodes point (directed edge) to other important nodes.  From a social network perspective, the question is who do you seek for an answer and then who does that person seek.   \n"
