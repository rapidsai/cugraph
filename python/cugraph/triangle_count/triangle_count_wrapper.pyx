cpdef triangles(input_graph):
    """
    Compute the triangle (number of cycles of length three) count of the 
    input graph.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    input_graph : cugraph.graph
      cugraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information,
      (edge weights are not used in this algorithm)
    
    Returns
    -------
    count : A 64 bit integer whose value gives the number of triangles in the
      graph.
      
    Example
    -------

    >>>> sources = cudf.Series(M.row)
    >>>> destinations = cudf.Series(M.col)
    >>>> G = cugraph.Graph()
