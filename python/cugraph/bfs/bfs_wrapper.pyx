cpdef bfs(G, start, directed=True):
    """
    Find the distances and predecessors for a breadth first traversal of a graph.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cugraph.graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information as an
        adjacency list.
    start : Integer
        The index of the graph vertex from which the traversal begins
    directed : bool
        Indicates whether the graph in question is a directed graph, or whether
        each edge has a corresponding reverse edge. (Allows optimizations if the
        graph is undirected)
    
    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        df['vertex'][i] gives the vertex id of the i'th vertex
        df['distance'][i] gives the path distance for the i'th vertex from the starting vertex
        df['predecessor'][i] gives for the i'th vertex the vertex it was reached from in the traversal
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = read_mtx_file(graph_file)
    >>> sources = cudf.Series(M.row)
    >>> destinations = cudf.Series(M.col)
    >>> G = cuGraph.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge_list(sources,destinations,none)
    >>> dist, pred = cuGraph.bfs(G, 0, false)
