def bfs(G, start, return_sp_counter=False):
    """
    Find the distances and predecessors for a breadth first traversal of a
    graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cugraph.graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information
        as an adjacency list.
    start : Integer
        The index of the graph vertex from which the traversal begins

    return_sp_counter : bool, optional, default=False
        Indicates if shortest path counters should be returned

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        df['vertex'][i] gives the vertex id of the i'th vertex

        df['distance'][i] gives the path distance for the i'th vertex from the
        starting vertex

        df['predecessor'][i] gives for the i'th vertex the vertex it was
        reached from in the traversal

        df['sp_counter'][i] gives for the i'th vertex the number of shortest
        path leading to it during traversal (Only if retrun_sp_counter is True)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G.from_cudf_edgelist(M, source='0', destination='1')
    >>> df = cugraph.bfs(G, 0)
