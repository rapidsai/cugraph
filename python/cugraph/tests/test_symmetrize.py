    #  in the new data frame.
    #
    #  We can accomplish this by doing the join (merge) where

    #
    #  Finally, let's check (in both directions) backwards.
    #  We want to make sure that no edges were created in
    #  the symmetrize logic that didn't already exist in one
    #  direction or the other.  This is a bit more complicated.
    #
    #  The complication here is that the original data could,
    #  for some edge (u,v) ALREADY contain the edge (v,u).  The
    #  symmetrized graph will not duplicate any edges, so the edge
    #  (u,v) will only be present once.  So we can't simply check
    #  counts of df2 joined with df1.
    #
    #  join1 will contain the join (merge) of df2 to df1 in the
    #        forward direction
    #  join2 will contain the join (merge) of df2 to df1 in the
    #        reverse direction
    #
    #  Finally, we'll do an outer join of join1 and join2, which
    #  will combine any (u,v)/(v,u) pairs that might exist into
    #  a joined row while keeping any (u,v) pairs that don't exist
    #  in both data frames as single rows.  This gives us a data frame
    #  with the same number of rows as the symmetrized data.
    #
    join1 = df2.merge(df1,
                      left_on=['src2', 'dst2'],
                      right_on=['src1', 'dst1'])

    #  Note, we don't need to check the reverse values... we checked
    #  them in both directions earlier.
