    """
    Return a new graph created from the edge list representaion. This function
    is added for NetworkX compatibility (this function is a RAPIDS version of
    NetworkX's from_pandas_edge_list()).  This function does not support
    multiple source or destination columns.  But does support renumbering

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        This cudf.DataFrame contains columns storing edge source vertices,
        destination (or target following NetworkX's terminology) vertices, and
        (optional) weights.
    source : string or integer
        This is used to index the source column.
    destination : string or integer
        This is used to index the destination (or target following NetworkX's
        terminology) column.
    edge_attr : string or integer, optional
        This pointer can be ``None``. If not, this is used to index the weight
        column.
    create_using : cuGraph.Graph
        Specify the type of Graph to create.  Default is cugraph.Graph
    renumber : bool
        If source and destination indices are not in range 0 to V where V
        is number of vertices, renumber argument should be True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)

    Initialize a graph from the edge list. It is an error to call this
    method on an initialized Graph object. Source argument is source
    column name and destination argument is destination column name.

    By default, renumbering is enabled to map the source and destination
    vertices into an index in the range [0, V) where V is the number
    of vertices.  If the input vertices are a single column of integers
    in the range [0, V), renumbering can be disabled and the original
    external vertex ids will be used.

    If weights are present, edge_attr argument is the weights column name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_df : pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame that contains edge information
    source : str or array-like
        source column name or array of column names
    destination : str or array-like
        destination column name or array of column names
    edge_attr : str or None
        the weights column name. Default is None
    renumber : bool
        Indicate whether or not to renumber the source and destination
        vertex IDs. Default is True.
    create_using: cugraph.DiGraph or cugraph.Graph
        Indicate whether to create a directed or undirected graph
