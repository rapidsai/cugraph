    """
    Return a new graph created from the edge list representaion. This function
    is added for NetworkX compatibility (this function is a RAPIDS version of
    NetworkX's from_pandas_edge_list()).

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        This cudf.DataFrame contains columns storing edge source vertices,
        destination (or target following NetworkX's terminology) vertices, and
        (optional) weights.
    source : string or integer
        This is used to index the source column.
    target : string or integer
        This is used to index the destination (or target following NetworkX's
        terminology) column.
    weight : string or integer, optional
        This pointer can be ``None``. If not, this is used to index the weight
        column.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G = cugraph.from_cudf_edgelist(M, source='0', target='1', weight='2')
