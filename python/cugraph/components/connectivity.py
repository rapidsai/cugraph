def weakly_connected_components(G):
    """
    Generate the Weakly Connected Components and attach a component label to
    each vertex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cugraph.Graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information
        as an edge list (edge weights are not used for this algorithm).
        Currently, the graph should be undirected where an undirected edge is
        represented by a directed edge in both directions. The adjacency list
        will be computed if not already present. The number of vertices should
        fit into a 32b int.

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
      df['labels'][i] gives the label id of the i'th vertex
      df['vertices'][i] gives the vertex id of the i'th vertex

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv',
                          delimiter = ' ',
                          dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'],
                          header=None)

    >>> G.from_cudf_edgelist(M, source='0', destination='1', edge_attr=None)
