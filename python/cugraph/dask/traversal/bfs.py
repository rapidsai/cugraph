    """
    Find the distances and predecessors for a breadth first traversal of a
    graph.
    The input graph must contain edge list as  dask-cudf dataframe with
    one partition per GPU.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : cugraph.DiGraph
        cuGraph graph descriptor, should contain the connectivity information
        as dask cudf edge list dataframe(edge weights are not used for this
        algorithm). Undirected Graph not currently supported.
    start : Integer
        Specify starting vertex for breadth-first search; this function
        iterates over edges in the component reachable from this node.
    return_distances : bool, optional, default=False
        Indicates if distances should be returned
    load_balance : bool, optional, default=True
        Set as True to perform load_balancing after global sorting of
        dask-cudf DataFrame. This ensures that the data is uniformly
        distributed among multiple GPUs to avoid over-loading.

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        df['vertex'][i] gives the vertex id of the i'th vertex

        df['distance'][i] gives the path distance for the i'th vertex from the
        starting vertex (Only if return_distances is True)

        df['predecessor'][i] gives for the i'th vertex the vertex it was
        reached from in the traversal

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import cugraph.dask as dcg
    >>> Comms.initialize()
    >>> chunksize = dcg.get_chunksize(input_data_path)
    >>> ddf = dask_cudf.read_csv(input_data_path, chunksize=chunksize,
                                 delimiter=' ',

                                 dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'])
    >>> dg = cugraph.DiGraph()
    >>> dg.from_dask_cudf_edgelist(ddf)
    >>> df = dcg.bfs(dg, 0)
