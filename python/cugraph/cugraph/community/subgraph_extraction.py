def subgraph(

    vertices: Union[cudf.Series, cudf.DataFrame],
) -> Union[Graph, "networkx.Graph"]:
    """
    Compute a subgraph of the existing graph including only the specified
    vertices.  This algorithm works with both directed and undirected graphs
    and does not actually traverse the edges, but instead simply pulls out any
    edges that are incident on vertices that are both contained in the vertices
    list.

    If no subgraph can be extracted from the vertices provided, a 'None' value
    will be returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cugraph.Graph or networkx.Graph
        The current implementation only supports weighted graphs.

    vertices : cudf.Series or cudf.DataFrame
        Specifies the vertices of the induced subgraph. For multi-column
        vertices, vertices should be provided as a cudf.DataFrame

    Returns
    -------
    Sg : cugraph.Graph or networkx.Graph
        A graph object containing the subgraph induced by the given vertex set.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from cugraph.experimental.datasets import karate
    >>> G = karate.get_graph(fetch=True)
    >>> verts = np.zeros(3, dtype=np.int32)
    >>> verts[0] = 0
    >>> verts[1] = 1
    >>> verts[2] = 2
    >>> sverts = cudf.Series(verts)
    >>> Sg = cugraph.subgraph(G, sverts)
