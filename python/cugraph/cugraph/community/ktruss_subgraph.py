    Returns the K-Truss subgraph of a graph for a specific k.

    The k-truss of a graph is a subgraph where each edge is part of at least
    (k−2) triangles. K-trusses are used for finding tighlty knit groups of
    vertices in a graph. A k-truss is a relaxation of a k-clique in the graph
    and was define in [1]. Finding cliques is computationally demanding and
    finding the maximal k-clique is known to be NP-Hard.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cuGraph.Graph or networkx.Graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor with connectivity information. k-Trusses are
        defined for only undirected graphs as they are defined for
        undirected triangle in a graph.

    k : int
        The desired k to be used for extracting the k-truss subgraph.

    Returns
    -------
    G_truss : cuGraph.Graph or networkx.Graph
        A cugraph graph descriptor with the k-truss subgraph for the given k.

    The k-truss of a graph is a subgraph where each edge is part of at least
    (k−2) triangles. K-trusses are used for finding tighlty knit groups of
    vertices in a graph. A k-truss is a relaxation of a k-clique in the graph

    finding the maximal k-clique is known to be NP-Hard.

    In contrast, finding a k-truss is computationally tractable as its
    key building block, namely triangle counting counting, can be executed
    in polnymomial time.Typically, it takes many iterations of triangle
    counting to find the k-truss of a graph. Yet these iterations operate
    on a weakly monotonically shrinking graph.
    Therefore, finding the k-truss of a graph can be done in a fairly
    reasonable amount of time. The solution in cuGraph is based on a
    GPU algorithm first shown in [2] and uses the triangle counting algorithm
    from [3].
