def ktruss_subgraph(input_graph, k: int) -> dask_cudf.DataFrame:
    """
    Returns the K-Truss subgraph of a graph for a specific k.

    The k-truss of a graph is a subgraph where each edge is incident to at
    least (kâˆ’2) triangles. K-trusses are used for finding tighlty knit groups
    of vertices in a graph. A k-truss is a relaxation of a k-clique in the graph.
    Finding cliques is computationally demanding and finding the maximal
    k-clique is known to be NP-Hard.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_graph : cugraph.Graph
        Graph or matrix object, which should contain the connectivity
        information. Edge weights, if present, should be single or double
        precision floating point values

    k : int
        The desired k to be used for extracting the k-truss subgraph.


    Returns
    -------
    k_truss_edge_lists : dask_cudf.DataFrame
        Distributed GPU data frame containing all source identifiers,
        destination identifiers, and edge weights belonging to the truss.
