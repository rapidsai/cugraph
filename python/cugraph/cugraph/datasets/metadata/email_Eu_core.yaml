description:
  The network was generated using email data from a large European research institution.
  We have anonymized information about all incoming and outgoing email between members
  of the research institution. There is an edge (u, v) in the network if person u
  sent person v at least one email. The e-mails only represent communication between
  institution members (the core), and the dataset does not contain incoming messages
  from or outgoing messages to the rest of the world.
