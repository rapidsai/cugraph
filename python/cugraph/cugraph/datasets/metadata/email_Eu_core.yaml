description:
  The network was generated using anonymized email data from a large European
  research institution. There is an edge (u, v) in the network if person u sent
  person v at least one email. The e-mails only represent communication between
  institution members (the core), and the dataset does not contain incoming messages
  from or outgoing messages to the rest of the world.
