def sorensen_w(input_graph, weights, vertex_pair=None):
    """
    Compute the weighted Sorensen similarity between each pair of vertices
    connected by an edge, or between arbitrary pairs of vertices specified by
    the user. Sorensen coefficient is defined between two sets as the ratio of
    twice the volume of their intersection divided by the volume of each set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_graph : cugraph.Graph
        cuGraph Graph instance, should contain the connectivity information
        as an edge list (edge weights are not used for this algorithm). The
        adjacency list will be computed if not already present.

    weights : cudf.DataFrame
        Specifies the weights to be used for each vertex.
        Vertex should be represented by multiple columns for multi-column
        vertices.

        weights['vertex'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the vertex identifiers
        weights['weight'] : cudf.Series
            Contains the weights of vertices

    vertex_pair : cudf.DataFrame, optional (default=None)
        A GPU dataframe consisting of two columns representing pairs of
        vertices. If provided, the sorensen coefficient is computed for the
        given vertex pairs, else, it is computed for all vertex pairs.

    Returns
    -------
    df : cudf.DataFrame
        GPU data frame of size E (the default) or the size of the given pairs
        (first, second) containing the Sorensen weights. The ordering is
        relative to the adjacency list, or that given by the specified vertex
        pairs.

        df['source'] : cudf.Series
            The source vertex ID
        df['destination'] : cudf.Series
            The destination vertex ID
        df['sorensen_coeff'] : cudf.Series
            The computed weighted Sorensen coefficient between the source and
            destination vertices.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import random
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv(datasets_path / 'karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    ...                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G.from_cudf_edgelist(M, source='0', destination='1')
    >>> # Create a dataframe containing the vertices with their
    >>> # corresponding weight
    >>> weights = cudf.DataFrame()
    >>> # Sample 10 random vertices from the graph and drop duplicates if
    >>> # there are any to avoid duplicates vertices with different weight
    >>> # value in the 'weights' dataframe
    >>> weights['vertex'] = G.nodes().sample(n=10).drop_duplicates()
    >>> # Reset the indices and drop the index column
    >>> weights.reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True)
    >>> # Create a weight column with random weights
    >>> weights['weight'] = [random.random() for w in range(
    ...                      len(weights['vertex']))]
    >>> df = cugraph.sorensen_w(G, weights)
