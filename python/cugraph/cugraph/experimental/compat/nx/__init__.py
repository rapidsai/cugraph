# FIXME: only perform the NetworkX imports below if NetworkX is installed. If
# it's determined that NetworkX is required to use nx compat, then the contents
# of this entire namespace may have to be optional, or packaged separately with
# a hard dependency on NetworkX.

# Start by populating this namespace with the same contents as
# networkx/__init__.py
from networkx import *

# Override the individual NetworkX objects loaded above with the cugraph.nx
# compat equivalents. This means if an equivalent compat obj is not available,
# the standard NetworkX obj will be used.
#
# Each cugraph obj should have the same module path as the
# NetworkX obj it isoverriding, and the submodules along the hierarchy should
# each import the same sub objects/modules as NetworkX does. For example,
# in NetworkX, "pagerank" is a function in
# "networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py", and is
# directly imported in the namespaces "networkx.algorithms.link_analysis",
# "networkx.algorithms", and "networkx". Therefore, the cugraph
# compat pagerank should be defined in a module of the same name and
# also be present in the same namespaces.
# Refer to the networkx __init__.py files when adding new overriding
# modules to ensure the same paths and used and namespaces are populated.

# namespace, but it will not create the equivalent networkx submodule
# hierarchy. For example, a user could expect to "import cugraph.nx.drawing",
# which should simply redirect to "networkx.drawing".
#
# This can be accomplished by updating sys.modules with the import path and
# module object of each NetworkX submodule in the NetworkX package hierarchy,
# but only for module paths that have not been added yet (otherwise this would
# overwrite the overides above).

# At this point, individual types that cugraph.nx are overriding
# could be used to override the corresponding types *inside* the
# networkx modules imported above. For example, the networkx graph generators
# will still return networkx.Graph objects instead of cugraph.nx.Graph
# objects (unless the user knows to pass a "create_using" arg, if available).
# For specific overrides, assignments could be made in the imported
# a networkx modules so cugraph.nx types are used by default.
# NOTE: this has the side-effect of causing all networkx
# imports in this python process/interpreter to use the override (ie. the user
# won't be able to use the original networkx types,
# even from a networkx import)
