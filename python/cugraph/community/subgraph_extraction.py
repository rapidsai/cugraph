def subgraph(G, vertices):
    """
    Compute a subgraph of the existing graph including only the specified
    vertices.  This algorithm works for both directed and undirected graphs,
    it does not actually traverse the edges, simply pulls out any edges that
    are incident on vertices that are both contained in the vertices list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : cugraph.Graph
        cuGraph graph descriptor
    vertices : cudf.Series
        Specifies the vertices of the induced subgraph

    Returns
    -------
    Sg : cugraph.Graph
        A graph object containing the subgraph induced by the given vertex set.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> M = cudf.read_csv('datasets/karate.csv', delimiter=' ',
    >>>                   dtype=['int32', 'int32', 'float32'], header=None)
    >>> sources = cudf.Series(M['0'])
    >>> destinations = cudf.Series(M['1'])
    >>> G = cugraph.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge_list(sources, destinations, None)
    >>> verts = numpy.zeros(3, dtype=numpy.int32)
    >>> verts[0] = 0
    >>> verts[1] = 1
    >>> verts[2] = 2
    >>> sverts = cudf.Series(verts)
    >>> Sg = cugraph.subgraph(G, sverts)
