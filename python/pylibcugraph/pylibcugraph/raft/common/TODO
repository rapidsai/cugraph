FIXME: The contents of this directory should be used from RAFT directly, rather than
being duplicated here.

pylibcugraph should be able to remove the copy of raft code added here once the connected components
API is updated to use the new cugraph C API. The only reason RAFT is being pulled in is because the
legacy connected components in pylibcugraph is using it.
