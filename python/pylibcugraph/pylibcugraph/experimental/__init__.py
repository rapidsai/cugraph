"""
The "experimental" package contains packages, functions, classes, etc. that
are ready for use but do not have their API signatures or implementation
finalized yet. This allows users to provide early feedback while still
permitting bigger design changes to take place.

ALL APIS IN EXPERIMENTAL ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OR REMOVAL.

Calling experimental objects will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning warning.

If an object is "promoted" to the public API, the experimental namespace will
continue to also have that object present for at least another release.  A
different warning will be output in that case, indicating that the experimental
API has been promoted and will no longer be importable from experimental much
longer.

# experimental_warning_wrapper() wraps the object in a function that provides
# the appropriate warning about using experimental code.

# promoted_experimental_warning_wrapper() is used instead when an object is present
# in both the experimental namespace and its final, public namespace.

# The convention of naming functions with the "EXPERIMENTAL__" prefix
# discourages users from directly importing experimental objects that don't have
# the appropriate warnings, such as what the wrapper and the "experimental"
# namespace name provides.
