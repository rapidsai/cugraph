# Cugraph test and benchmark data

## Python

This directory contains small public datasets in `mtx` and `csv` format used by cuGraph's python tests. Graph details:

**netscience** : The graph netscience contains a coauthorship network of scientists working on network theory and experiment, as compiled by M. Newman in May 2006.



### Modified datasets 

The datasets below were added to provide input that contains self-loops, string vertex IDs, isolated vertices, and multiple edges.

## Custom path to larger datasets directory  

Cugraph's C++ and Python analytics tests need larger datasets (>5GB uncompressed) and reference results (>125MB uncompressed). They can be downloaded by running the provided script from the `datasets` directory.
```
cd <repo>/datasets
./get_test_data.sh
```
You may run this script from elsewhere and store C++ or Python test input to another location.

Before running the tests, you should let cuGraph know where to find the test input by using:
```
export RAPIDS_DATASET_ROOT_DIR=<path_to_datasets_dir>
```


## Benchmarks

Cugraph benchmarks (which can be found [here](../benchmarks)) also use datasets installed to this folder. Because the datasets used for benchmarking are also quite large (~14GB uncompressed), they are not installed by default. To install datasets for benchmarks, run the same script shown above from the `datasets` directory using the `--benchmark` option:
```
cd <repo>/datasets
./get_test_data.sh --benchmark
```
The datasets installed for benchmarks currently include CSV files for use in creating both directed and undirected graphs:
```
<repo>/datasets/csv
 |- directed
 |--- cit-Patents.csv       (250M)
 |--- soc-LiveJournal1.csv  (965M)
 |- undirected
 |--- europe_osm.csv        (1.8G)
 |--- hollywood.csv         (1.5G)
 |--- soc-twitter-2010.csv  (8.8G)
```
The benchmark datasets are described below:
| Graph             | V          | E             | Directed | Weighted |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| cit-Patents       |  3,774,768 |    16,518,948 | Yes      | No       |
| soc-LiveJournal1  |  4,847,571 |    43,369,619 | Yes      | No       |
| europe_osm        | 50,912,018 |    54,054,660 | No       | No       |
| hollywood         |  1,139,905 |    57,515,616 | No       | No       |
| soc-twitter-2010  | 21,297,772 |   265,025,809 | No       | No       |

**cit-Patents** : A citation graph that includes all citations made by patents granted between 1975 and 1999, totaling 16,522,438 citations.
**soc-LiveJournal** : A graph of the LiveJournal social network.
**europe_osm** : A graph of OpenStreetMap data for Europe.
**hollywood** : A graph of movie actors where vertices are actors, and two actors are joined by an edge whenever they appeared in a movie together.
**soc-twitter-2010** : A network of follower relationships from a snapshot of Twitter in 2010, where an edge from i to j indicates that j is a follower of i.

_NOTE: the benchmark datasets were converted to a CSV format from their original format described in the reference URL below, and in doing so had edge weights and isolated vertices discarded._
