[![Build Status](http://18.191.94.64/buildStatus/icon?job=cugraph-master)](http://18.191.94.64/job/cugraph-master/)  [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cugraph/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/nightly/)

The [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) cuGraph library is a collection of graph analytics that process data found in GPU Dataframes - see [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).  cuGraph aims to provide a NetworkX-like API that will be familiar to data scientists, so they can now build GPU-accelerated workflows more easily.

For examples on how to use cuGraph browse our complete [API documentation](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/stable/), or check out our detailed [notebooks]( https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks/tree/master/cugraph).

**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/master/README.md) ensure you are on the `master` branch.

## Getting cuGraph

### Intro
There are 4 ways to get cuGraph :
1. [Quick start with Docker Demo Repo](#quick)
1. [Conda Installation](#conda)
1. [Build from Source](#source)

## Quick Start  

Please see the [Demo Docker Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/), choosing a tag based on the NVIDIA CUDA version you’re running. This provides a ready to run Docker container with example notebooks and data, showcasing how you can utilize all of the RAPIDS libraries: cuDF, cuML, and cuGraph.

<a name="conda"></a>

### Conda

It is easy to install cuGraph using conda. You can get a minimal conda installation with [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or get the full installation with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

Install and update cuGraph using the conda command:

```bash
# CUDA 9.2
conda install -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c numba -c conda-forge -c defaults cugraph cudatoolkit=9.2

# CUDA 10.0
conda install -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c numba -c conda-forge -c defaults cugraph cudatoolkit=10.0
```

Note: This conda installation only applies to Linux and Python versions 3.6/3.7.

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries aim to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.

### Apache Arrow on GPU

The GPU version of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a common API that enables efficient interchange of tabular data between processes running on the GPU. End-to-end computation on the GPU avoids unnecessary copying and converting of data off the GPU, reducing compute time and cost for high-performance analytics common in artificial intelligence workloads. As the name implies, cuDF uses the Apache Arrow columnar data format on the GPU. Currently, a subset of the features in Apache Arrow are supported.
